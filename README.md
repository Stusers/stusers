# 👋 Hi, I'm Stanislav Ustinov

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science & Software Engineering student at Maynooth University. I enjoy building full-stack applications that solve real-world problems — especially those that mix strong technical architecture with thoughtful user experience.

I'm particularly interested in automation, developer tooling, and systems that reduce friction in everyday life. Whether it's streamlining booking systems or turning package labels into instant notifications, I’m all about practical, maintainable code.
